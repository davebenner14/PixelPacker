## Why PixelPacker?

This project was an absolute joy to work on. Not only was it a nostalgic journey back to one of the most iconic video games of all time, but it was also an exercise in pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with JavaScript. As I navigated the challenges of recreating the game mechanics, graphics, and audio, I was continually thrilled to discover new ways to use foundational web technologies to breathe life into this classic.

PixelPacker is written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, alongside HTML and CSS for layout and styling. The decision to keep the tech stack simple was a tribute to the power of JavaScript, demonstrating its capacity to handle even complex game mechanics smoothly.
